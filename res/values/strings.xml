        <item>The CPUfreq governor ondemand sets the CPU depending on the
current usage. To do this the CPU must have the capability to
switch the frequency very quickly.</item>
        <item>The CPUfreq governor conservative, much like the ondemand
governor, sets the CPU depending on the current usage.  It differs in
behaviour in that it gracefully increases and decreases the CPU speed
rather than jumping to max speed the moment there is any load on the
CPU.  This behaviour more suitable in a battery powered environment.</item>
        <item>The CPUfreq governor interactive is designed for latency-sensitive,
interactive workloads. This governor sets the CPU speed depending on
usage, similar to ondemand and conservative governors.  However,
the governor is more aggressive about scaling the CPU speed up in
response to CPU-intensive activity.

Sampling the CPU load every X ms can lead to under-powering the CPU
for X ms, leading to dropped frames, stuttering UI, etc.  Instead of
sampling the cpu at a specified rate, the interactive governor will
check whether to scale the cpu frequency up soon after coming out of
idle.  When the cpu comes out of idle, a timer is configured to fire
within 1-2 ticks.  If the cpu is very busy between exiting idle and
when the timer fires then we assume the cpu is underpowered and ramp
to MAX speed.

If the cpu was not sufficiently busy to immediately ramp to MAX speed,
then governor evaluates the cpu load since the last speed adjustment,
choosing the highest value between that longer-term load or the
short-term load since idle exit to determine the cpu speed to ramp to.</item>
        <item>Result of Erasmux rewriting the complete code of interactive governor.
             Main goal is to optimize battery life without comprising performance. 
             Still, not as battery friendly as smartassV2 since screen-on minimum frequency is greater than frequencies used during screen-off. Smartass would jump up to highest frequency too often as well.</item>

        <item>Measured in uS , this is how often the kernel look at the CPU usage and make decisions on what to do about the frequency. Higher values means CPU polls less often. For lower frequencies, this could be considered an advantage since it might not jump to next frequency very often, but for higher frequencies, the scale-down time will be increased.</item>
        <item>Measured in percentage from 1 to 100, When CPU load reaches this point, governor will scale CPU up. Higher value means less responsiveness and lower values corresponds to more responsiveness at the cost of battery. </item>
        <item>Default value is 0. Setting a higher value will bias the governor towards lower frequency steps. Use this if you want CPU to spend less time on higher frequencies. A better alternative would be to underclock to a lower frequency than using powersave bias.</item>
        <item>In the simplest form, sampling_down_factor determines how often CPU should stay at higher frequencies when truly busy. Default behavior is fast switching to lower frequencies (1). Having sampling_down_factor set to 1 makes no changes from existing behavior (for the non-modified ondemand), but having sampling_down_factor set to a value greater than 1 causes it to act as a multiplier for the scheduling interval for re-evaluating the load when the CPU is at its highest clock frequency (which is scaling_max_freq) due to high load. This improves performance by reducing the overhead of load evaluation and helping the CPU stay at its highest clock frequency when it is truly busy, rather than shifting back and forth in speed. This tunable has no effect on behavior at lower frequencies/lower CPU loads.</item>
        <item>This factor indirectly calculate the down-threshold of Ondemand. 
            After completing sampling-down-factor*sampling-rate at max frequency because of high load, 
            governor samples the load again to calculate an estimate of the new target frequency in a 
            way that the lowest frequency will be chosen that would not trigger up_threshold in the 
            next sample. Because triggering up-threshold will again cause CPU to scale up to max frequency. 
            During this choice down_differential is taken into account as a breathing room value. 
            Target frequency is calculated as max_load_freq / (up_threshold - down_differential). The obtained value might be a non-existent value in the freq_table and CPU driver will round it off to a value in freq_table. max_load_freq is the theoretical frequency at which CPU can handle 100% workload. 
            It is usually a value below scaling_max_freq.</item>
        <item>Whenever up-scaling logic is triggered the governor instructs the CPU to raise its frequency by freq_step percentage of max allowed frequency.</item>

        <item>(click to show algorithms explanation)\n\nTo avoid congestion collapse, TCP uses a multi-faceted congestion-control strategy.
             For each connection, TCP maintains a congestion window, 
             limiting the total number of unacknowledged packets that may be in transit end-to-end. 
             This is somewhat analogous to TCP\'s sliding window used for flow control. 
             TCP uses a mechanism called slow start to increase the congestion window after a connection is initialized and after a timeout. 
             It starts with a window of two times the maximum segment size (MSS). 
             Although the initial rate is low, the rate of increase is very rapid: 
             for every packet acknowledged, the congestion window increases by 1 MSS 
             so that the congestion window effectively doubles for every round-trip time (RTT). 
             When the congestion window exceeds a threshold ssthresh the algorithm enters a new state, 
             called congestion avoidance. In some implementations (e.g., Linux), the initial ssthresh is large,
              and so the first slow start usually ends after a loss. 
              However, ssthresh is updated at the end of each slow start, 
              and will often affect subsequent slow starts triggered by timeouts.</item>

        <item>Inserts all the incoming I/O requests to a First In First Out queue and implements request merging. Best used with storage devices that does not depend on mechanical movement to access data (yes, like our flash drives). Advantage here is that flash drives does not require reordering of multiple I/O requests unlike in normal hard drives.</item>
        <item>Goal is to minimize I/O latency or starvation of a request. The same is achieved by round robin policy to be fair among multiple I/O requests. Five queues are aggressively used to reorder incoming requests.</item>
        <item>Completely Fair Queuing scheduler maintains a scalable per-process I/O queue and attempts to distribute the available I/O bandwidth equally among all I/O requests. Each per-process queue contains synchronous requests from processes. Time slice allocated for each queue depends on the priority of the parent process. V2 of CFQ has some fixes which solves process\' i/o starvation and some small backward seeks in the hope of improving responsiveness.</item>
        <item>Instead of time slices allocation by CFQ, BFQ assigns budgets. Disk is granted to an active process until it\'s budget (number of sectors) expires. BFQ assigns high budgets to non-read tasks. Budget assigned to a process varies over time as a function of it\'s behavior.</item>
        <item>Simple I/O scheduler aims to keep minimum overhead to achieve low latency to serve I/O requests. No priority quesues concepts, but only basic merging. Sio is a mix between noop and deadline. No reordering or sorting of requests.</item>
        <item>Unlike other schedulers, synchronous and asynchronous requests are not treated separately, instead a deadline is imposed for fairness. The next request to be served is based on it\'s distance from last request.</item>

        <item>Triple duplicate ACKS are treated the same as a timeout. Tahoe will perform \"fast retransmit\", set the slow start threshold to half the current congestion window, reduce congestion window to 1 MSS, and reset to slow-start state.</item>
        <item>If three duplicate ACKs are received (i.e., four ACKs acknowledging the same packet, which are not piggybacked on data, and do not change the receiver\'s advertised window), Reno will halve the congestion window (instead of setting it to 1 MSS like Tahoe), set the slow start threshold equal to the congestion window, perform a fast retransmit, and enter a phase called Fast Recovery. 
    	    If an ACK times out, slow start is used as it is with Tahoe.</item>
        <item>Until the mid-1990s, all of TCP\'s set timeouts and measured round-trip delays were based upon only the last transmitted packet in the transmit buffer. University of Arizona researchers Larry Peterson and Lawrence Brakmo introduced TCP Vegas, named after the largest Nevada city, in which timeouts were set and round-trip delays were measured for every packet in the transmit buffer. In addition, TCP Vegas uses additive increases in the congestion window. This variant was not widely deployed outside Peterson\'s laboratory. In a comparison study of various TCP congestion control algorithms, TCP Vegas appeared to be the smoothest followed by TCP CUBIC.</item>
        <item>TCP New Reno, defined by RFC 6582 (which obsoletes previous definitions in RFC 3782 and RFC 2582), improves retransmission during the fast-recovery phase of TCP Reno. During fast recovery, for every duplicate ACK that is returned to TCP New Reno, a new unsent packet from the end of the congestion window is sent, to keep the transmit window full. For every ACK that makes partial progress in the sequence space, the sender assumes that the ACK points to a new hole, and the next packet beyond the ACKed sequence number is sent.
Because the timeout timer is reset whenever there is progress in the transmit buffer, this allows New Reno to fill large holes, or multiple holes, in the sequence space – much like TCP SACK. Because New Reno can send new packets at the end of the congestion window during fast recovery, high throughput is maintained during the hole-filling process, even when there are multiple holes, of multiple packets each. When TCP enters fast recovery it records the highest outstanding unacknowledged packet sequence number. When this sequence number is acknowledged, TCP returns to the congestion avoidance state.
A problem occurs with New Reno when there are no packet losses but instead, packets are reordered by more than 3 packet sequence numbers. When this happens, New Reno mistakenly enters fast recovery, but when the reordered packet is delivered, ACK sequence-number progress occurs and from there until the end of fast recovery, every bit of sequence-number progress produces a duplicate and needless retransmission that is immediately ACKed.
New Reno performs as well as SACK at low packet error rates, and substantially outperforms Reno at high error rates.</item>
        <item>TCP Hybla aims to eliminate penalization of TCP connections that incorporate a high-latency terrestrial or satellite radio link, due to their longer round trip times. It stems from an analytical evaluation of the congestion window dynamics, which suggests the necessary modifications to remove the performance dependence on RTT.</item>
        <item>Binary Increase Congestion control is an implementation of TCP with an optimized congestion control algorithm for high speed networks with high latency (called LFN, long fat networks, in RFC 1072). BIC is used by default in Linux kernels 2.6.8 through 2.6.18.</item>
        <item>CUBIC is a less aggressive and more systematic derivative of BIC, in which the window is a cubic function of time since the last congestion event, with the inflection point set to the window prior to the event. CUBIC is used by default in Linux kernels since version 2.6.19.</item>
        <item>TCP Westwood (TCPW) is a sender-side-only modification to TCP New Reno that is intended to better handle large bandwidth-delay product paths (large pipes), with potential packet loss due to transmission or other errors (leaky pipes), and with dynamic load (dynamic pipes).
TCP Westwood relies on mining the ACK stream for information to help it better set the congestion control parameters: Slow Start Threshold (ssthresh), and Congestion Window (cwin). In TCP Westwood, an \"Eligible Rate\" is estimated and used by the sender to update ssthresh and cwin upon loss indication, or during its \"Agile Probing\" phase, a proposed modification to the well-known Slow Start phase. In addition, a scheme called Persistent Non Congestion Detection (PNCD) has been devised to detect persistent lack of congestion and induce an Agile Probing phase to expeditiously utilize large dynamic bandwidth.</item>
        <item>Scalable TCP modifies the congestion control algorithm. Instead of halving the congestion window size, each packet loss decreases the congestion window by a small fraction (a factor of 1/8 instead of Standard TCP\'s 1/2) until packet loss stops. When packet loss stops, the rate is ramped up at a slow fixed rate (one packet is added for every one hundred successful acknowledgements) instead of the Standard TCP rate that\'s the inverse of the congestion window size (thus very large windows take a long time to recover). This helps reduce the recovery time on 10 Gbit links from 4+ hours (using Standard TCP) to less than 15 seconds when the round trip time is 200 milliseconds.</item>
        <item>H-TCP is a loss-based algorithm, using additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) to control TCP\'s congestion window. It is one of many TCP congestion avoidance algorithms which seeks to increase the aggressiveness of TCP on high bandwidth-delay product (BDP) paths, while maintaining \"TCP friendliness\" for small BDP paths. H-TCP increases its aggressiveness (in particular, the rate of additive increase) as the time since the previous loss increases. This avoids the problem encountered by HSTCP and BIC TCP of making flows more aggressive if their windows are already large. Thus, new flows can be expected to converge to fairness faster under HTCP than HSTCP and BIC TCP.</item>

swapcache reclaim.  Decreasing vfs_cache_pressure causes the kernel to prefer
to retain dentry and inode caches. When vfs_cache_pressure=0, the kernel will
never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory pressure and this can easily
lead to out-of-memory conditions. Increasing vfs_cache_pressure beyond 100
causes the kernel to prefer to reclaim dentries and inodes.</item>
